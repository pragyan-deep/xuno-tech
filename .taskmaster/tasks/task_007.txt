# Task ID: 7
# Title: Create Technology Tools Section
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build a grid showcasing the technology stack with logos and labels
# Details:
1. Design a responsive grid for technology logos
2. Include the specified technologies:
   - React
   - Next.js
   - Node.js
   - Python
   - PostgreSQL
   - Docker
   - Kubernetes
   - AWS
   - Azure
   - GCP
3. Create consistent-sized cards for each technology with logo and name
4. Add subtle hover effects
5. Implement fade-in animation when scrolled into view
6. Ensure logos are visible in both light and dark themes (use different versions if needed)
7. Make grid responsive with appropriate spacing

# Test Strategy:
Test responsive grid layout across all device sizes. Verify all technology logos display correctly. Check hover effects. Ensure fade-in animations work on scroll. Test visibility in both themes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design responsive technology grid layout [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the responsive grid structure for displaying technology logos across all device sizes
### Details:
1. Use CSS Grid or Flexbox with TailwindCSS to create a responsive grid layout
2. Implement appropriate breakpoints for mobile (1 column), tablet (2-3 columns), and desktop (4-5 columns)
3. Define consistent card sizes and spacing between grid items
4. Set up container max-width and padding for proper alignment with other page sections
5. Ensure the grid maintains proper spacing and alignment when resizing

## 2. Create technology card component with logo handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop a reusable card component that displays technology logos with proper light/dark theme support
### Details:
1. Create a TechnologyCard component that accepts logo, name, and optional description props
2. Implement conditional rendering for light/dark theme logo variants
3. Add proper image optimization using Next.js Image component with appropriate sizes
4. Ensure logos maintain proper aspect ratios and consistent dimensions
5. Add alt text for accessibility
6. Implement proper error handling for missing logos

## 3. Implement hover effects and animations [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Add interactive hover effects to technology cards and implement fade-in animations on scroll
### Details:
1. Use Framer Motion or CSS transitions for smooth hover effects (scale, shadow, etc.)
2. Implement intersection observer or Framer Motion's scroll animations for fade-in effects
3. Ensure animations are subtle and professional (avoid excessive movement)
4. Add staggered animation for grid items appearing sequentially
5. Respect user preferences for reduced motion using the prefers-reduced-motion media query

## 4. Populate grid with technology data [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Create data structure for technology information and populate the grid with all required technologies
### Details:
1. Create a data file with information for all required technologies (React, Next.js, Node.js, etc.)
2. Include name, description, logo paths (light/dark variants), and optional links
3. Implement proper data typing with TypeScript interfaces
4. Source high-quality SVG logos for each technology
5. Organize logos in appropriate public directory structure
6. Add any additional metadata needed for filtering or categorization

## 5. Integrate section with page layout and test cross-browser compatibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Integrate the technology grid section with the main page layout and ensure cross-browser/device compatibility
### Details:
1. Add proper section heading and optional description text
2. Implement proper semantic HTML structure with appropriate ARIA attributes
3. Test and optimize for cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
4. Ensure the section integrates properly with the page's scroll behavior
5. Optimize performance by implementing proper code splitting and lazy loading
6. Add appropriate data-testid attributes for testing
