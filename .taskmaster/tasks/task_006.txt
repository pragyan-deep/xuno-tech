# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Portfolio Section
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a grid of project cards showcasing the company's portfolio with hover zoom effects
# Details:
1. Design a responsive grid layout for portfolio projects
2. Create project cards with:
   - Project image/thumbnail
   - Project title
   - Brief description
   - Technologies used (optional tags)
3. Implement hover zoom effect using TailwindCSS transform scale
4. Add subtle transition animations
5. Implement fade-in animation when scrolled into view
6. Ensure grid responsively adjusts columns based on screen size
7. Add placeholder content that can be easily replaced with actual portfolio items

# Test Strategy:
Test responsive grid across all device sizes. Verify hover zoom effects work smoothly. Check fade-in animations on scroll. Ensure images load properly and maintain aspect ratio. Test theme compatibility.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Responsive Grid Layout [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a responsive grid layout for portfolio projects using TailwindCSS grid system
### Details:
Implement a responsive grid layout using TailwindCSS grid classes. Configure grid-cols-1 for mobile, grid-cols-2 for tablet, and grid-cols-3 for desktop. Use gap-4 or gap-6 for spacing between items. Ensure the grid container has proper padding and max-width constraints. Research and implement the latest TailwindCSS grid best practices for 2024.

## 2. Create Project Card Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop a reusable project card component with image, title, description, and technology tags
### Details:
Create a TypeScript React component for project cards with proper props typing. Include image container with proper aspect ratio (16:9), project title using heading element, brief description with character limit, and optional technology tags using Tailwind's badge styling. Ensure the component is accessible with proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes. Use Next.js Image component for optimized image loading.

## 3. Implement Hover and Animation Effects [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Add hover zoom effects and fade-in animations using TailwindCSS and Framer Motion
### Details:
Implement hover zoom effect using TailwindCSS transform scale (scale-105 or scale-110) with transition-transform duration-300. Add subtle box-shadow increase on hover. For fade-in animations, use Framer Motion's latest API (v10+) with the useInView hook for scroll-triggered animations. Configure proper animation variants with staggered children for a cascading effect.

## 4. Create Portfolio Data Structure and Placeholder Content [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Design a flexible data structure for portfolio items and implement placeholder content
### Details:
Create a TypeScript interface for portfolio items with properties for image, title, description, technologies, link, etc. Implement a data file with 6-9 placeholder portfolio items using realistic content and free stock images. Structure the data to be easily replaceable with actual portfolio items later. Consider implementing categories or filtering capabilities for future expansion.

## 5. Integrate Portfolio Section with Page Layout [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Connect the portfolio section to the main page layout with proper section heading and spacing
### Details:
Create a Portfolio section component that integrates with the main page layout. Add a section heading with appropriate typography. Implement proper vertical spacing between the section heading and grid. Add an optional 'View All Projects' button that links to a dedicated portfolio page (to be implemented later). Ensure the section has the correct ID for navbar linking and proper padding for scroll margin when navigating via the navbar.
