# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Scroll Animations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add fade-in animations for all sections when they are scrolled into view
# Details:
1. Choose between Framer Motion or Intersection Observer API for scroll animations
2. If using Intersection Observer:
   - Create a custom hook `useInView` that detects when elements enter viewport
   - Apply CSS classes conditionally based on visibility
3. If using Framer Motion:
   - Implement `motion` components with `whileInView` animations
4. Apply consistent fade-in animations to all main sections:
   - Hero/About
   - Services
   - Portfolio
   - Technology Tools
   - Industries
   - Contact
5. Add subtle staggered animations for grid items within sections
6. Ensure animations are subtle and professional, not distracting
7. Optimize animations for performance

# Test Strategy:
Test animations across different devices and browsers. Verify animations trigger at the correct scroll positions. Check for any performance issues. Ensure animations work with both light and dark themes. Test with reduced motion preferences enabled.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research and select animation library [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Evaluate Framer Motion and Intersection Observer API to determine the best approach for implementing scroll animations
### Details:
Compare Framer Motion (v10+) and Intersection Observer API for performance, browser compatibility, and ease of implementation. Consider bundle size impact, animation capabilities, and integration with Next.js and TypeScript. Document findings and make a recommendation based on project requirements. Check compatibility with latest Next.js version (14+) and TailwindCSS (v3.3+).

## 2. Create reusable animation components/hooks [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Develop reusable animation components or hooks based on the selected animation approach
### Details:
If using Framer Motion: Create reusable motion components with configurable animation properties. If using Intersection Observer: Develop a custom `useInView` hook that detects when elements enter the viewport and returns visibility state. Ensure TypeScript type safety and proper documentation. Implement options for animation duration, delay, and easing functions.

## 3. Implement section fade-in animations [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Apply consistent fade-in animations to all main sections when they enter the viewport
### Details:
Implement fade-in animations for all main sections (Hero/About, Services, Portfolio, Technology Tools, Industries, Contact). Ensure animations are subtle and professional. Use a consistent animation pattern across sections while allowing for minor variations where appropriate. Optimize for both light and dark themes.

## 4. Implement staggered animations for grid items [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3
### Description: Add subtle staggered animations for grid items within sections to create a cascading effect
### Details:
Implement staggered animations for grid items in the Services, Portfolio, Technology Tools, and Industries sections. Configure appropriate delay between each item's animation. Ensure the staggered effect is subtle and enhances rather than distracts from the content. Implement responsive behavior that adjusts stagger timing based on viewport size.

## 5. Optimize animations for performance and accessibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3, 11.4
### Description: Ensure animations are performant across devices and respect user accessibility preferences
### Details:
Optimize animations to prevent layout shifts and maintain 60fps. Implement `prefers-reduced-motion` media query support to disable or simplify animations for users who prefer reduced motion. Use hardware-accelerated properties (transform, opacity) instead of properties that trigger repaints. Test and optimize for mobile devices. Ensure animations don't interfere with page content accessibility.
